    content: `Hello, Welcome to DarkThrone Reborn!

I am very excited to launch this project into a pre-alpha stage. This is a very early stage of the project and there is still a lot of work to be done. I am looking forward to working with the community to make this game the best it can be.

This isn't the first time I set out to recreate DarkThrone. When the original game shut down it's servers I immediately started on a project called Dark Curse. The goal was to create an open source version of the game that the community could collaborate on together. I made several design decisions that I ultimately killed my enjoyment and stopped me from developing the project. Mostly this was around the tech stack I chose. I went for the absolute bare minimum with the goal of making it as accessible for new developers as possible to join in. This choice was ultimately a bad one however, development was slow and more painful than it needed to be.

I never really intended to pick this back up again. I had moved on to start a new company and that consumed all of my time. As that started to grow however, and as I began to bring on employees, I found myself finally having free time again. I tried picking up the Dark Curse project again however I very quickly hit the same hurdles that stopped me the first time. I decided to start over from scratch and this time I would make the game for myself. I would make the game that I wanted to play. I would make the game that I wanted to make.

I've been working on this in secret over the last few months. I didn't want to announce anything until there was something that prople could actually play. I can understand that it must be frustrating to know that something is potentially coming and then for it to never materialise. I wanted to make sure that I had something to show before I announced anything.

And with that, here we are. I hope you enjoy the game and I look forward to working with you all to make it the best it can be!
